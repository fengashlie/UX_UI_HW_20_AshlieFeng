        <h3>UX Research</h3>
        <p>I understand what my audience's wants and how they view the world. This means mastering the ability to plan,
          conduct, and analyze findings from a variety of research methods.</p>

        <h3>Information Architecture</h3>
        <p>Organizing information in an understandable manner. Applicable to websites, apps, software, printed
          materials, and even physical spaces.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Prototyping</h3>
        <p>I ensure there is a match between a system and its users before construction on the final product begins.
          Prototypes allow me to test both page functionality and overall navigation. As problems are identified, I
          usually go through several iterations before landing on a design that meets both business and user goals.</p>

        <h2>Redesigned an all-in-one resource hub for the Chicago Underwater Hockey team</h2>
        <p>Our goal is to provide a one-stop shop where users can discover the sport, find logistic information, and
          leverage resources to help them improve as players. Right now users are having to fend for themselves when
          it comes to finding information on the sport and the Chicago team.

        <h2>Redesign the Department of the Interiors Website</h2>
        <p> When navigating the US Department of Interior website users encountered frustration with the amount of
          disorganized categories and visual clutter. Many of the locations for links were confusing and users did not
          know where to find certain sections. The main objective of this project is to provide the user with a clear
          and balanced path that will allow them to effortlessly find the information they are looking for.
