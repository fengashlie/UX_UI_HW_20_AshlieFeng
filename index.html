      <h1 class="display-4">The Challenge</h1>
      <p class="lead">When navigating the US Department of Interior website users encountered frustration with the amount of disorganized categories and visual clutter.  Many of the locations for links were confusing and users did not know where to find certain sections. The main objective of this project is to provide the user with a clear and balanced path that will allow them to effortlessly find the information they are looking for. 

        The site presented an overwhelming amount of inconsistent design and navigation, disorganized and redundant information, a cluttered aesthetic, compromised heuristics and UI principles and wording that created confusion. We found among other issues were lack of consistency, improper use of hierarchy, standards and recognition. </p>
      <hr class="my-4">
      <h1 class="display-4">The Solution</h1>
      <p>Examine the current site and execute information architecture restructuring and user interface redesign with the objective of applying the UX and UI best practices and achieving a pleasant user experience.   Design a website that is easy to navigate and makes it easier for people who aren't familiar with the highly-technical language to find what they're looking for.</p>

      <p class="lead"> 
        Many users coming to the Department of Interiors site have trouble navigating the site through all the clutter and confusing jargon. 
        <h1 class="display-4">Identifying User Needs</h1> 
        Our goal was to understand how users navigate the Department of Interior website. We then performed the following:
        - Created a proto persona
        - User interviews (5)
        - User tested the current DOI navigation to determine pain points. 
            1. The navigation is not consistant and confusing
            2. The social media was listed too many times on the home page
            3. The use of headers was inconsistant
            4. Inconsistant button colors </p>
